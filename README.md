# hello-world
My first GitHub project!

Hi everyone, I'm an aspiring web developer new to the inside workings of the interwebs. 
I get through Seattle's 9 month "wet season" by knitting, playing ukulele and piano, learning languages, reading and binge-watching classic TV series like Buffy, Smallville, Alias and Six Feet Under.
Now I'm glad to have a new obsession to work on - learning to code!
