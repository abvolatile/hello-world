# hello-world
My first GitHub project!

Hi everyone, I'm an aspiring web/software developer, and completely new to the industry. 
I typically get through the Northwest's 9 month "wet season" by knitting, playing ukulele and piano, learning languages, reading and binge-watching series on Netflix.
Now I'm glad to have a new obsession to work on - learning to code!
